# MorseCodeChrome
## A Chrome extension that transcribes text with Morse Code

Samuel F. B. Morse created a code for the electric telegraph in the early 1840s that allowed alphanumeric characters to be encoded into a sequence of short and long tones. It is still widely used among radio operators as a means of identifying themselves, as well as communicating messages over a channel too narrow or noisy for speech transmission.[<sup>1</sup>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

This extension will transcribe the morse code for text in the page.
